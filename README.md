# XHmpeg

This is a GUI wrapper for FFmpeg, built for computers running Windows 10 or newer.

This program includes the following features from FFmpeg:
- Video format conversion to mp4, mkv, avi, or mov
- Audio format conversions to mp3, wav, aac, or flac
- Change resolution, FPS, and bitrate of a video
- Trim video length down to a specified duration
- View file size of video / audio file before conversion

## Project Completion Progress
This program is nowhere near completion, and only features the GUI for what's to come. There will be a compiled executable available once the program has some functionality.

## Note on downloading this program
Since this program uses ffmpeg, ffprobe and ffplay, make sure to add those binaries into xhmpeg/tools/ffmpeg/ folder to ensure the program works upon building the application
